!!! Tip "My Core Focus:"
    My core area of expertise/industry is the use of machine learning (ML) methods in high-stakes decision-making settings. I'm interested in developing solutions that remove barriers to applying machine learning to real-world problems. I have contributed to application fields such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and crowdsourcing.

!!! Example "Detailed Interests"

    !!! Note "Uncertainty mitigation and/or estimation:"
    - In high-risk decision-making situations like healthcare or autonomous driving, human specialists cannot trust machine learning outputs. My aim is to find mitigative solutions to this problem.
    - Additionally, to improve generalization ability, I'm developing ML methods that account for model and data uncertainty.

    !!! Note "Finding New Applications of ML in Real-Life Settings:"
    - Through my numerous collaborations with experts from various departments at the University of Arizona, ranging from engineering to medicine and agriculture.

    !!! Note "Software Design"
    - Years of working with a diverse group of experts, most notably through my advisory role at the University of Arizona's Data Science Institute, have given me a thorough grasp of the whole machine learning research and product management, from data management and development to deployment. This includes, but is not limited to, various aspects of ML product scaling such as life cycle management, containerization, and scaling (Kubernetes, etc.).

    !!! Note "Healthcare & Social Entrepreneur"
    - My eagerness to fully understand the entire ML industry cycle persuaded me to broaden my expertise beyond ML development.
    - Various graduate level courses, great mentors, the McGuire new venture development program at UArizona, and Entrepreneurship for Biomedicine at Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Luis have shaped my entrepreneurial background.
    - This has given me a broader perspective on existing barriers to new technology entry into real life settings. I plan to use my business experience to delve deeper into the exploration of ML obstacles in real-world scenarios.

    !!! Note "Teaching"
    - Passing on my knowledge of ML development, is something I enjoy doing.
    - In addition to mentoring new students, teaching classes, webinars, and seminars, I recently obtained my data carpentry instruction certificate which I plan to use to transfer my knowledge to the community.
